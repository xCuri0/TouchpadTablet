# TouchpadTablet
Turns your precision touchpad into a tablet with custom area support. Created to play osu! and using a capacitive pen is recommended

# Requirements
Precision touchpad driver (you can download it usually if your laptop didn't come with it)
Windows 7+ though I have only tested it on Windows 10

# Usage
Measure your touchpad and put its size (mm) into config.txt. You can also change the area size (mm) in that file and larger areas than the touchpad are allowed though they may make parts of the screen unreachable.

# TODO
Test Windows 7 and 8/8.1. They both support HID_USAGE_DIGITIZER_TOUCH_PAD if precision drivers are installed
