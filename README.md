# TouchpadTablet
Turns your precision touchpad into a tablet with custom area support

# Requirements
Precision touchpad driver (you can download it usually if your laptop didn't come with it)
Windows 7+ though I have only tested it on Windows 10

# TODO
Test Windows 7 and 8/8.1. They both support HID_USAGE_DIGITIZER_TOUCH_PAD if precision drivers are installed
